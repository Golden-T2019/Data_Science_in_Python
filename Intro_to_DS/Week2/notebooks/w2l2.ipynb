    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn how to work with an Jupyter (or IPython) Notebook from within our course JupyterHub server. You will first learn how to view notebooks online, before executing notebooks on the server. Next you will learn how to enter basic Python commands in the notebook and execute them. Finally, you will learn about IPython magic commands and how they can give you access to the underlying operating system and increased functionality.\n",
