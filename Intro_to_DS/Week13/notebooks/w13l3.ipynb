    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about more advanced object oriented\n",
    "programming concepts and how to use them effectively by using the Python\n",
    "programming language. This includes understanding the concept of classes\n",
    "as interfaces and specific implementations of an interface. The use of\n",
    "methods to encapsulate the state of an object, and finally the use of\n",
    "inheritance to build object oriented hierarchies.\n",

    "### Objectives ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the concept of class methods.\n",
    "- Understand how to define an interface.\n",
    "- Understand how to create a succesful implementation of an interface.\n",
    "- Understand how to use inheritance to construct object hierarchies.\n",
