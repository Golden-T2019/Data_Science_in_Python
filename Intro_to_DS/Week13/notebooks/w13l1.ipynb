    "## Introduction to Object Oriented Programming ##\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will learn about object oriented programming (OOP),\n",
    "a paradigm in which new data types are created by using classes and\n",
    "access to the data in these new data types can be controlled by using\n",
    "methods. This enables a programmer to encapsulate the state of a system\n",
    "to minimize unintentional side effects, and to (potentially) improve\n",
    "performance. Existing classes can be extended by using inheritance, and\n",
    "class hierarchies can be dynamically created to support polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives ###\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the the fundamental concepts behind object oriented programming.\n",
    "- Understand how OOP can be used to create new data types.\n",
    "- Understand the concepts of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.\n",
