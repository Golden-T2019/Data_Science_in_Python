    "numerical arrays and matrices in Python by using the numpy library.\n",
    "Numpy arrays underlie many of the Python data science software stack,\n",
    "and thus understanding them can improve your overall efficacy. Next you\n",
    "will be introduced to the Pandas library. Pandas introduces several new\n",
    "data structures into the Python language, including the Series and the\n",
    "DataFrame, both of which allow you to access data by a column label in\n",
    "the same manner you used numerical indices with a NumPy array. Pandas\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understand how to use the Numpy library to perform fast array and matrix operations\n",
    "- Understand how to use the Pandas library to read and write structured data into a Python program.\n",
    "- Understand how to use a Pandas DataFrame to select, group, and filter data.\n",
