    "database schema. First, you will earn about basic SQL Syntax, including\n",
    "the allowed SQL data types. While this will focus on the Sqlite3 syntax\n",
    "and data types,  more general information will be conveyed. Next, you\n",
    "will learn how to create and delete databases. Next you will learn how\n",
