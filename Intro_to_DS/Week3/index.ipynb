    "This week you will begin to learn how to use the Python programming\n",
    "language to write simple programs, and you will also learn about\n",
    "permissions and controlling processes within Unix-like Systems. First,\n",
    "you will learn about permission-related commands within Unix-like\n",
    "systems, such as chmod, umask, su, sudo, chown, and chgrp. Second, you\n",
    "will learn how to control processes within Unix-like systems through\n",
    "commands including top, ps, jobs, bg, fg, kill, killall, and shutdown.\n",
    "Third, you will learn how to perform various function calls within\n",
    "Python, as well as create your own functions. Finally, you will learn\n",
    "how to create conditional statements, value-returning functions and\n",
    "iterating statements.\n",

    "- Know how to utilize various permissions-based commands, such as id, umask, sudo, etc. \n",
    "- Understand how to use various process-based commands, such as ps, top, bg, kill, etc.\n",
