    "\n",
    "In this week, you will learn about functional programming. This\n",
    "programming paradigm employs functions to change the state of data,\n",
    "where the functions process input data and produce outputs, without\n",
    "changing the state of the rest of the program. Functional programming\n",
    "can result in high performance computations for certain types of\n",
    "problems, and can, therefore, be a useful skill to possess.\n",

    "### Objectives ###\n",
    "\n",
    "##### By the end of this lesson, you should accomplish the following learning objectives:######\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the basic concepts behind functional programming.\n",
    "- Understand how to employ the `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` methods.\n",
    "- Understand how to write and use lambda functions.\n",
