    "## Introduction to Markov Chains & MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we introduce Markov chains, a simple technique to model systems that change state with well-define probabilities. Specifically, a Markov chain is memoryless, which means the transition is independent of previous steps. A Markov chain model can be used to predict the state of a system under uncertainty, and forms the basis for more powerful modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models, that extend this approach to individual components within the overall system. Next, we introduce Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a technique to generate samples from (potentially) complex distributions. Monte Carlo techniques have been used for many years to numerically evaluate a function by using random sampling (e.g., numerical integration). Markov chain Monte Carlo extends these ideas to use a Markov chain to sample from a distribution that we wish to numerically evaluate, and we use Monte Carlo to perform the numerical evaluation. \n",
